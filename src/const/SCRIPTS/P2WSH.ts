  shortDescription:
    "The standard SegWit format for more complex transactions that require a script.",
  longDescription: [
    "P2WSH scripts serve a role similar to P2SH in the realm of SegWit, catering to more intricate transaction types.  The logic for a P2WSH witness script & output pubKeyScript is exactly the same as a P2SH input sigScript & output pubKeyScript. However, there is a large difference in the op_codes explicitly expressed in the raw transaction. Wallets/clients know that when a P2WSH output is detected they'll need to insert the common P2SH op_codes; therefore, a P2WSH pubKeyScript requires only one specific item: the hashed lock script.Here's a step-by-step breakdown:",
    "1. Validate Input Hashed Lock Script Matches Previous Output Hashed Lock Script. First, to spend Bitcoin sent to a hashed script, it must be proven that the script weâ€™re unlocking matches the original hashed script. This means that the stack first consumes the entire lock/redeem script as a single array & hashes it with HASH160. This is then compared to the original hashed script using OP_EQUAL.",
    "2. Execution Of Unlock Script & Lock Script. If the  last op_code (OP_EQUAL) of the previous validation step returns 1/true, then we can move on to actually unlocking the lock script by pushing both the lock script (now separated into the appropriate data & op_code bytes). This is a more normal execution in which all elements are pushed to the stack & then processed in typical LIFO behavior.",
