    Block: A block is a data structure used to record Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.

    Transaction: A transaction is a transfer of Bitcoin value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the blockchain.

    Address: A Bitcoin address is used to receive and send transactions on the Bitcoin network. It represents the destination of a Bitcoin payment.

    Wallet: A wallet is a software program or service that stores private and public keys and interacts with the Bitcoin network to send and receive Bitcoin.

    UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output): UTXO represents a piece of Bitcoin that has not been spent and is available to be used as an input in a new transaction.

    Node: A node is a computer that participates in the Bitcoin network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain, validating transactions, and relaying data to other nodes.

    Address Balance: The total amount of Bitcoin associated with a particular Bitcoin address.

    Mempool: The mempool (memory pool) is a collection of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block and added to the blockchain.

    Mining: Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain by solving complex mathematical puzzles. Miners are rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.

    Fee: Transaction fees are small amounts of Bitcoin paid to miners as an incentive to include transactions in blocks.

    Confirmation: A confirmation occurs when a transaction is included in a block and added to the blockchain. The number of confirmations indicates how many blocks have been added on top of the block containing the transaction.

These are some of the main nouns you'll encounter in Bitcoin RPC documentation. Depending on the specific functionality you're working with, there may be additional terms and concepts to consider.
